# Marlboro-Community-Garden-Compost-Sensors

Project Summary (Please see "IoT based compost monitoring" for more details.)

As a part of my project for the rank of Eagle Scout, I programmed and installed remote temperature and moisture sensors in the 'closed' compost bins of the Marlboro Community Garden. The composting process is driven by the action of micro-organisms which need certain conditions to function smoothly. The optimal range for temperature is 140-160 degrees Fahrenheit, while the optimal range for moisture is 50-60%. Temperature and moisture can be regulated by aerating or watering the compost, respectively. The sensing system involves five devices that work together in a mesh network. Four devices were each placed in one of four bin complexes located around the garden. These were the sensor devices, and collected data directly from the compost. A fifth gateway device was mounted on the fence on the east side of the garden. The gateway device collects data from the other devices and publishes it to a website by connecting to wi-fi from the Morganville Firehouse. The purpose of this project was to alert gardeners when conditions in the compost systems were not ideal, and help to accelerate the composting process.
